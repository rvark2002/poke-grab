Poke Grab
============

Poke Grab is a Node.js Application built on Express and MongoDB

Its goal was to replicate a simple version of Pokemon GO. Where a User can login using a username and then go to the wild and encounter a slew of random pokemon. 

Each Pokemon would have a randomized level from 1-100 and relied on the poke api (link below) 

Users could then view all of their caught pokemon inside their PC Box
